# 🗃️ archive/

This folder holds **past experiments, prototypes, and decommissioned tools** that still have value — whether as reference, legacy scaffolding, or inspiration.

Everything here was once live. It earned its scars. Use it as a **sandbox of solved problems** or a reminder of what not to repeat.

## 📁 Structure

- `project-name/`: Top-level folders named after each archived project
- `project-name/README.md`: A quick overview of what it was, what worked, what broke
- `project-name/_versions/`: Optional folder for saved states or zips

## ✅ Use Guidelines

- Never delete anything from `archive/` — move it here from `lab/` when a project is paused, completed, or abandoned.
- Add a timestamp or version tag when archiving.
- Document the *why* behind its retirement. One sentence is enough.
