# VibeLegal (Archived)

This folder contains components removed from the `VibeLegal` project during cleanup of the `fix/core-generation-bugs` PR.

## âœ… What Worked
- Component structure was modular and UI-ready
- Logic for forms and routing generally functioned as expected

## âš  What Broke
- Contract rendering failed on edge cases
- State management was getting bloated
- Components tightly coupled to outdated API logic

## ðŸ’¡ Notes

Use with caution â€” this is legacy code.
